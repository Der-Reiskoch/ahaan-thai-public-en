The special feature of this curry is the use of kaffir limes or their juice, which gives the curry a rather sour note.\nDepending on the recipe, tamarind paste is also added along with the kaffir limes. There are also recipes that use only tamarind paste as the source of the sour flavor.\nThe name of the curry comes from the traditionally used freshwater fish, the slender catfish (Pangasius larnaudii), which is called \u0026ldquo;Plaa Taepo\u0026rdquo; ( ปลาเทโพ ) in Thai. However, this fish has such a strong aroma that it is not often used nowadays.\n","tags":["curry","pork","fish"],"recipes":["/reiskoch/wissenswertes/thai-currys-aus-dem-gelben-buch/?lang=en#gaeng-taepo","https://rachelcooksthai.com/red-curry-pork-belly-water-spinach/","https://hungryinthailand.com/red-curry-pork-belly/","https://importfood.com/recipes/recipe/132-gaeng-tay-poe","/youtube/H0rDQ7YrJgE"],"regions":["central-thailand"],"alternativeNames":["Gaeng Tepo","Gaeng Tae Po","Gaeng Tay Poe","Gang Tay Po"],"imageUrl":"_thaiindex/g/gaeng_taepo.jpg","thaiName":"แกงเทโพ"},{"url":"/encyclopedia/g/gaeng-woon-sen/","transcription":"Gaeng Woon Sen","summary":"Curry with Meat and Glass Noodles","description":"\u0026ldquo;Gaeng Woon Sen\u0026rdquo; ( แกงวุ้นเส้น ) is a curry or rather a soup that is made on the basis of a simple paste from chilis, garlic, lemongrass and galangal.

The origin of the name is not definitively documented. However, it could be traced back to a very popular fried rice that was served in the early 20th century on the railway line from Bangkok to Hua Hin and contained luxurious ingredients for that time, such as butter and sauces from Europe.\nOther theories see a connection between the rice dish and the construction of the \u0026ldquo;Death Railway\u0026rdquo; between Thailand and Myanmar, which the Japanese army had built by forced laborers and prisoners of war during World War II. During this inhumane tragedy, the prisoners were said to be happy about any meal, no matter how simple.\n","tags":["rice","stir-fried","pork"],"recipes":["https://steemit.com/food/@wikawee/thai-old-style-fried-rice-khao-pad-rod-fai","https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/16988363-easy-fried-rice-the-old-school-thai-railway-fried-rice-recipe","/cookbooks/bangkok-by-she-simmers/#211","/youtube/h6B1rovHFTk","/youtube/AVdNT71SV58"],"variationOf":"/encyclopedia/k/khao-pad","regions":["central-thailand"],"alternativeNames":["Khao Pad Rod Fai","Khao Phat Rot Fai","Khao Phat Rotfai"],"imageUrl":"_thaiindex/k/khao_pad_rot_fai.jpg","thaiName":"ข้าวผัดรถไฟ"},{"url":"/encyclopedia/k/khao-pad-sai-ua/","transcription":"Khao Pad Sai Ua","summary":"Fried rice with northern Thai sausage","description":"\u0026ldquo;Khao Pad Sai Ua\u0026rdquo; ( ข้าวผัดไส้อั่ว ) is fried rice prepared with sliced sai ua, spring onions and whisked eggs.

The best known is probably the one prepared with coconut milk and a paste base. It is usually served with meat and cooked wheat noodles, which are often fried as well.\nThis creamy soup probably originated in Yunnan and was brought to northern Thailand by traders and refugees belonging to the Muslim Chin Haw tribe . In neighboring Myanmar, there is a very similar soup called “Ohn no khao swè” (အုန်းနို့ခေါက်ဆွဲ). To distinguish it from other soups with the same name, it is sometimes also called “Khao Soi Chiang Mai” ( ข้าวซอยเชียงใหม่ ), “Khao Soi Islam” ( ข้าวซอยอิสลาม ) or “Khao Soi Kati” ( ข้าวซอยกะทิ ).\nThere are also other Khao Soi variations without coconut milk. For example, “Khao Soi Mae Sai” ( ข้าวซอยแม่สาย ) from the border town of the same name is more similar to Guai Tiao Nam Ngiau and is served with rice noodles. As with Nam Ngiau soup, the origin of this variant is probably the Shan.\n\u0026ldquo;Khao Soi Nam Naa\u0026rdquo; ( ข้าวซอยน้ำหน้า ) from the Chiang Khong area, on the other hand, is a clear broth with rice noodles served with a topping of minced meat and tomatoes, not unlike Nam Prik Ong. This variant is a typical dish of the Tai Leu, an ethnic group that also lives in areas of southern China\u0026rsquo;s Yunnan province, Shan State in Myanmar, and Laos.\nOne explanation for this great variation lies in the origin of the name “Khao Soi.” In the Lao language, it can be literally translated as “cut rice,” but this probably refers to cut noodles, which made their way from Yunnan in China to the southern neighboring regions. Thus, Khao Soi could also simply be regarded as an umbrella term for “noodle soup.”\nSourcesThe assumptions mentioned here regarding the origin of the various soups called “Khao Soi” come from the following sources:\n","tags":["soup","curry","noodles"],"recipes":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khao_soi","/cookbooks/pok-pok-noodles/","/cookbooks/the-food-of-northern-thailand/"],"uses":["/encyclopedia/k/krueang-gaeng-khao-soi"],"variations":["/encyclopedia/k/khao-soi-gai","/encyclopedia/k/khao-soi-moo","/encyclopedia/k/khao-soi-nam-naa","/encyclopedia/k/khao-soi-nuea","/encyclopedia/k/khao-soi-yunnan"],"fittedBy":["/encyclopedia/p/pak-khad-dong/"],"regions":["northern-thailand"],"imageUrl":"_thaiindex/k/khao_soi.jpg","thaiName":"ข้าวซอย"},{"url":"/encyclopedia/k/khao-soi-gai/","transcription":"Khao Soi Gai","summary":"Curry noodle soup with chicken","description":"“Khao Soi Gai” ( ข้าวซอยไก่ ) is a northern Thai noodle soup with chicken, prepared with coconut milk and a spicy aromatic paste.

Others believe that the dish originated in neighboring Myanmar.\nThere are various regional variations of Khao Soi, which differ in the type of broth or noodles used.
